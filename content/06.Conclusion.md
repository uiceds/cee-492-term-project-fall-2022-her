### Discussion and Conclusion

In summary, the variety of characteristics present in the raw tree data set posed quite a challenge when we approached the construction of a well-performing predictive model. Unfortunately, none of the three predictive models (decision tree, linear regression, and neural net) illustrated sufficient performance, though some were better than others, such as the linear regression model using four independent variables (tree age, average tree height, average leaf area, and average crown diameter) and the simple neural net using one input variable (DBH) to predict one output variable (TreeHt).

Interestingly, a general pattern emerged. By increasing the number of independent variables used in any of the models, predictive performance improved and the models' error decreased.

[Add discussion about why raw tree data is hard to accurately predict? Talk about what we hoped to use these models for, and perhaps what might be done in the future to study tree data in a better way? Think bigger picture meaning, outside of the analyses we did.]
