## Predictive Modeling Section

Based on some of the above correlations and supporting evidence from the US Forest Service Research Archives [2], there are strong correlation between diameter at breast heights (dbh) and tree age, tree height, leaf area, crown height, and average crown diameter. 
Therefore, several predictive models using 3 different machine learning techniques were explored to select the most suitable model to predict (dbh) based on the aforementioned variables. Those techniques include (1) decision-tree algorism, (2) regression, and (3) neural networks. To enable a reliable performance evaluation procedure, the collected data was divided into two separate datasets for each developed predictive model: (1) training dataset that includes 70% of all the available data that will be used in developing the model, and (2) testing dataset that includes 30% of all available data that will be used for evaluating the performance of the developed model. The following three sections provide a detailed description of these aforementioned 3 machine learning techniques.

### Decision-Tree Algorithm 

This model was run with two to five independent variables in order to predict DBH. The output of these iterations are as follows:

With each addition of independent variables, the mean coefficient of determination increased, and the mean squared error decreased. Overall the decision tree model for this data is not robust and does not do a great job at fitting the data. The correlation coefficient gets increasingly closer to one with additional variables, meaning the linear relation is better with more variables and DBH than a few variables and DBH. This finding shows that a linear regression model might be a better method for modeling this dataset.


### Regression

This technique depends on developing multiple linear regression model between the dependent variable and independent variables. Starting with a simple regression model that include only one independent variable (tree age) to predict the dependent variable (average dbh). The predictive formula is used to calculate the coefficient of determination, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and model accuracy. As shown in Figure @fig:Reg_model1, the model achieved R squared of 74%, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 21.12, and accuracy of 12.4%.

Further investigation was performed to determine why the accuracy is low. After plotting average dbh in y-axis and age in the x-axis for training and testing datasets. Two data points were determined to be outliers, as shown in Figure @fig:Reg_model1_plot)

The second model was performed using the same dependent and independent variables after excluding outliersâ€™ data point. The model achieved R squared of 88%, RMSE of 10.91, and accuracy of 87%, as shown in Figure @fig:ig:Reg_Model2
